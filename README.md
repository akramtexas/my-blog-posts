Essays at the intersection of culture, software, technology, and engineering (by Akram Ahmad)

## About Me

Hi there! I'm a Principal Software Engineer at Dell Technologies (in the IoT Solutions Division) and I am based in Austin (Texas). My focus remains, as ever, on architecting, designing, and developing scalable distributed systems infrastructure and applications. I'm passionate about Go ([aka golang](http://programming-digressions.blogspot.com/2018/04/the-go-programming-language.html)), Java, Scala, Reactive Programming, AI, and perfecting the fine art of programming. Oh, and [I'm really into writing, too](http://programming-digressions.blogspot.com/2017/11/on-writing-or-how-i-write.html).

### Prerequisites (to reading!)

None whatsoever; simply a sense of curiosity and adventure :)

- [Best Reactive Programming Books](http://programming-digressions.blogspot.com/2017/08/best-reactive-programming-books-this.html))
